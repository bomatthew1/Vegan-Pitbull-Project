				<h2> Introduction </h2>
				
				<p> Many people are surprised to learn that not only can dogs enjoy vibrant health on a vegan diet, but just like people, their physical condition can actually improve as a result of eliminating animal foods. <br> <br>

				By genus, dogs are classified as carnivorous, but metabolically, they are actually omnivorous. This means that their nutritional requirements can be adequately met with a plant-based diet – as they can source or synthesize all the nutrients they require from plant foods with supplementation. <br> <br>

				Skeptical? Check out the story of Bramble, a vegan dog who lived to the age of 28 – making her one of the world’s longest-living dogs. Or how about the story of Piggy: <br> <br>

				“When we first found him on the streets of the Dominican Republic, Piggy was just a pup – he had no hair, he was skin hanging over a skeleton, and he could barely walk a couple of blocks,” Tod recalls. “After a few months recovering on his vegetarian diet, he literally tripled in size to 45 pounds, gained a foot in height, exploded with healthy, soft fur … and he runs for miles on his three legs.” <br> <br>

				Still not sure? Consider this story from CNN, where six veterinarians agreed that the nutritional requirements of dogs can be adequately met with a vegan diet. <br> <br>

				“The important thing is that you use a diet that has been shown to be nutritionally adequate for whatever stage of life you’re feeding, and it is absolutely possible to find a good quality commercial pet food that doesn’t have animal products in it,” states veterinarian Kathryn E. Michel, an associate professor of nutrition at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Veterinary Medicine. <br> <br>

				Michel recommends using commercial pet food that has gone through the Association of American Feed Control Officials feeding trials. “Or, if you prefer to cook meals from scratch, consult a credentialed expert in dog nutrition to ensure a proper balance of essential nutrients.” (See resources at the end of this article for more information.) <br> <br>

				Sandy Anderson, owner and founder of VeganPet in Australia, explains the philosophy behind the development of her products: <br> <br>

				“The National Research Council Committee on Animal Nutrition (NRC) and the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) have published guidelines of the minimum dietary requirements for dogs and cats… [Since 2005,] I have been working on making a dog and cat food using vegan alternatives. This food meets the NRC and AAFCO standards and, in some instances, exceeds them. The body’s basic building, energizing and replacing materials can come from a meat or chicken source or from a soybean and seaweed source. It doesn’t matter. What matters is that the basic cellular structure is the same from either source. I have now found all the vegan alternatives and am able to produce nutritionally-balanced food for both cats and dogs.” <br> <br>

				In addition, there is evidence demonstrating that vegan diets might actually offer benefits to dogs who suffer from various health problems. As stated on the Harbingers of a New Age website: <br> <br>

				“Studies and numerous case reports have shown that nutritionally sound vegetarian companion animal diets appear to be associated with the following health benefits: increased overall health and vitality, decreased incidences of cancer, infections, hypothyroidism, ectoparasites (fleas, ticks, lice and mites), improved coat condition, allergy control, weight control, arthritis regression, diabetes regression and cataract resolution.” <br> <br>

				Over decades of experience of caring for rescued dogs in Gentle World, we’ve learned a number of things along the way that we feel are important for caregivers to know about. <br> <br>

				As stated in the CNN article, because a dog has certain important nutritional requirements that are different to our own, it is necessary to pay careful attention to their needs, as you are making their decisions for them. But with a well-supplemented, balanced diet that is based on whole-foods, your canine companions can easily thrive as vegans. The health and vitality of our four-legged friends has actually surprised a few conventional vets! <br> <br>

				If your dog is currently eating an animal-based diet, it’s wise to be gentle and careful when switching to plant-based food, as any change in diet has the potential to cause digestive disorders. Many dogs (especially young dogs who don’t have ingrained carnivorous habits) will take to it right away, but for some, it may take a few days before they are even willing to try this new, meat-free fare. <br> <br>

				During the transition time, it’s a good idea to offer them foods that they find particularly irresistible (read on for suggestions). Once they realize how delicious their new food can be, we find that they tend to adjust pretty easily! <br> <br>

				There are some important differences to be aware of. Non-vegetarian dogs generally eat one meal a day, whereas vegan dogs should get two smaller meals daily, plus snacks. A healthy snack would be several dog biscuits or a handful or two (depending on the size of your dog) of dry kibble. <br> <br>

				For those who want the convenience or reassurance of ready-made foods that are nutritionally complete, there are a number of 100% vegetarian dog foods and snacks that meet canine nutrient standards. But to make it more affordable, and to incorporate more whole foods, we usually mix in home-made foods (explained below), along with some of the pre-made kibble, canned food or VegeDog supplement to help meet nutritional requirements. <br> <br>

				Other simple points to take note of: <br> <br>

				Meals should be served at room temperature or slightly warmed, along with a clean bowl of water.
				Dogs cannot process excess salt so be aware of giving them too much, especially if you’re adding some of your own dinner or leftovers to their meals.
				Taking your dog on daily walks in the sunshine is as important for their intake of Vitamin D as it is for the physical exercise.
				NB: There are some common human foods that cause toxic reactions in dogs. Onions, raw garlic, chocolate, nutmeg, raisins, and macadamia nuts are all known to be toxic to dogs. The ASPCA has a good list of foods that should remain ‘people foods’. </p>

				<h2> Putting Together a Basic Meal </h2>
				
				<p> At least a third to a half of your dog’s meal should consist of a quality protein source. The remaining portion can be made up of a variety of whole grains, raw and cooked vegetables, as well as certain supplemental items. The following pages contain more specifics. <br> <br>

				The Vegan Dog Nutrition Association recommends that the base of the meal be comprised of soybeans, lentils, rice, oats and sweet potatoes. Our favorite vegan vet tells us that pinto beans are the most non-allergenic food for vegan dogs, and that (along with sweet potatoes and carrots) they provide a good basis for the diet. Pinto beans and sweet potatoes can also be used exclusively for up to 6 to 8 weeks to determine whether your dog is suffering from food allergies. <br> <br>
	
				NB: All legumes should be well-cooked (until very soft) and preferably mashed or puréed in a food processor. <br> <br>

				Adding a sprinkling of sea vegetable flakes such as kelp or dulse helps to ensure a dietary source of minerals. <br> <br>

				Dogs can enjoy fruit in small amounts – if they will eat it. Our dogs have enjoyed a variety of fruits, ranging from bananas, apples and orange, to watermelon! Just make sure that you don’t feed your dog fruit too close to a high-protein meal. The enzymes are different and can cause digestive discomfort. <br> <br>
